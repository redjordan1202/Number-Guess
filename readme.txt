Number Guess Game:

This program is my first real python program. Its a slightly modified port of the Triple X game from the gamedev.tv Unreal Engine and C++ course.
I wanted to try my hand at some free form programming while learning python. Trying to build a program from scratch without following along with a tutorial to do so.
Its my first program made entirely by scratch. Of course some of the code is borrowed from example code mostly to help me with some of the more complex statements and concepts
